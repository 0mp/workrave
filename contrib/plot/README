Some scripts to graph keyboarding activity over time. There are two parts:

    * workrave-dump extracts the statistics from the workrave
      historical statistics file. Run it like so:

          % workrave-dump > workrave.out

    * gnuplot-workrave reads in the "workrave.out" file generated
      above (the filename is fixed) and generates a PNG graph as shown
      above. Run it like so:

          % gnuplot-workrave

These scripts are completely free for anyone to do whatever they want.
Let me know if you can figure out a way to eliminate the need for the
intermediate "workrave.out" file.
