Hi,
	I would first like to say that I very grateful that someone has gone out of 
their way to make such a great program. I have a very serious RSI -- for 
which I'm getting treated -- and workrave is helping to minimize possible 
damage to my hands. Thanks!  :) 

	Onto my problem/question. The pain in my right-hand is especially sensitive 
to using a mouse. Even placing my hand on the mouse and clicking something 
can trigger pain immediately that is not otherwise triggered by my keyboard. 
I try to use my keyboard for everything. One of the only situations where I 
haven't found a keyboard replacement for something I'd previously do with a 
mouse is for the workrave "postpone." Is there a keyboard shortcut for this? 

	If such a feature does not exist, could you please add this to your list of 
feature requests and consider it for a future addition to the program as I 
think it will definitely help others like me who are looking to gain 
independence from the (evil) mouse.
